# Digital-Clock
Prints Current Time in C

Asks user input for a name,
prints good morning, good afternoon, or good night depending on AM or PM with the input name.

I learned how to be more proficient in C and formatting codes nicely as well as inserting comments.
I am also learning how to be better with Git and Github and using the terminal.
